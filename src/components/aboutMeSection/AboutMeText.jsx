      <p>
        I’m a passionate MERN stack developer with a strong foundation in
        frontend development, especially React. I love building intuitive user
        interfaces and real-world web applications that solve real problems.
        With over 3.5 years of experience in the tech industry, I’ve worked on
        projects ranging from internal tools like QuickMigrate CLI to engaging
        apps like LoveSpark and AutoCare Hub. I specialize in React, Tailwind
        CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I’m constantly exploring new tools and
        technologies to stay sharp and innovative. I believe in learning by
        doing—whether it’s contributing to full-stack projects, mentoring peers,
        or building open-source tools. When I’m not coding, I enjoy sharing
        knowledge, exploring tech trends, and working on passion projects that
        push my limits. Let’s build something amazing together!
